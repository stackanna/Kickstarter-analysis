# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing Analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends. 
This is an in-depth analysis of Kickstarter campaigns broken down into different categories. Based on this data we are able to conclude what categories of kickstarter campaigns are more likely to reach their funding goals & complete a successful launch date. An overview of the project is to visualize the relationship between outcome of campaigns and the launch month. Some challenges encountered were the COUNTIF functions. The formula would be entered correctly but it would not update the spreadsheet appropriately. Therefore making it impossible for me to complete a correct graph allowing me to draw appropriate conclusions. 

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The first conclusion we can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date is that the most number of successful plays were during the Summer months. The second conclusion we are able to draw based on the Launch Date is that the most amount of canceled plays were during the coldest winter month of January. You can draw a final conclusion that the plays are more willing to succeed with less canceled and failed shows during the Summer months.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some of the limitations of this dataset are:
-  the lack of explanation as to why the plays were canceled. 
- The categories of plays are unknown leaving us unable to draw conclusions as to why specific plays are more successful than others.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-  We would be able to create line graphs comparing successful kickstarter categories, drawing conclusions as to which type of entertainment is more likely to be funded. 
- We could create bar graphs to compare the months of failed kickstarter campaigns to draw conclusions as to why they failed.
